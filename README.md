## This is the final project for Courseera course "Getting and Cleaning data"
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The project requirment includes submiting: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.

## A R script called run_analysis.R was created that does the following: 
*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
*Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
